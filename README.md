# Purgatory
The official purgatory plugin! Needs PurgatoryAPI to run! 


A few simple instructions that may help you understand how to use this plugin goes as follows:

1: Set a main world. This is the world the player will respawn at each time they escape purgatory! 
Do this by doing
/purgatory setMainWorld
2: Add your purgatory world to the purgatory world list!
Do this by doing
/purgatory addWorld (World Name Here)
A few notes about this, 
It is a list! If multiple purgatory worlds exist, it will prefer to go to the one with the least players, and if it is viable. You can also configure the max players per
purgatory world by doing
/purgatory worlds (World Name Here) maxplayers (Num)
and you can change whether it is viable by doing this
/purgatory worlds (World Name Here) viable (true or false)
3: Set the exit location so that players can leave purgatory!
Do this by doing
/purgatoryf setExitLocation
In order to escape, players must enter that location and crouch. Then they will be teleported back to the Main World!

Vwhala! You have succesfully set up your purgatory world! Remember, if you are a coder, this runs on the PurgatoryAPI! If you ever want to add anything to the
plugin, you have the option to do so easily! If enough people ask, I might even set up a tutorial for how to use the PurgatoryAPI, though I doubt it will be needed.
Have fun with it!
